# YouTube Clipper Usage Guide

## Getting Started
1. Paste a YouTube URL into the input field.
2. The video will load in the preview area.

## Precision Clipping
To get the exact part of the video you want, use our "Premium" Clipping Tools:

### 1. Visual Timeline Scrubber
Below the video player, you will see a dual-handle slider.
- **Left Handle**: Drag to set the **Start Time**.
- **Right Handle**: Drag to set the **End Time**.
- **Middle Bar**: Drag the bar between the handles to move the entire clip (keeping the same duration) to a different part of the video.

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts (Power User)
Speed up your workflow with these hotkeys:
- **Space**: Play / Pause video.
- **I**: Set **In-point** (Start Time) at the current playback position.
- **O**: Set **Out-point** (End Time) at the current playback position.
- **Left / Right Arrow**: Seek backward/forward by 5 seconds.
- **Shift + Left / Right Arrow**: Seek by 0.05 seconds (frame-by-frame precision).

### 3. Nudge Controls
Next to the timestamp inputs, use the nudge buttons for fine-tuning:
- **< / >**: Nudge by **0.05 seconds** (1 frame). Perfect for aligning with audio.
- **<< / >>**: Nudge by **1.0 second**. Good for rough adjustments.

## Formats & Downloads
- Select your desired quality from the dropdown.
- Toggle "Subtitles" to burn in captions (if available).
- Click the big **Arrow Down** button to start processing.
